# SMS Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes SMS messages to classify their sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. Using Python and scikit-learn, the notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Highlights

* Preprocessing text data (removing stopwords, lowercasing, tokenization)
* Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
* Training classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
* Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports
* Visualizations of data distribution and model performance

## Notebook Structure

* **Introduction & Setup:** Overview and library imports
* **Data Exploration:** Inspection of SMS dataset and sentiment distribution
* **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming text data
* **Feature Engineering:** Applying TF-IDF vectorization
* **Model Building:** Training sentiment classifiers
* **Evaluation:** Analyzing accuracy and confusion matrices
* **Discussion:** Insights, limitations, and possible improvements

## Next Steps

* Experiment with deep learning approaches (e.g., LSTM)
* Incorporate hyperparameter tuning
* Explore advanced text features (n-grams, embeddings)
